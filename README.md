# Boursorama CSV to OFX converter

[Use it here!](https://cosmith.github.io/boursorama-csv-to-ofx/)

[Boursorama](https://www.boursorama.com) doesn't seem to be interested in providing an OFX export option, so I decided to make it myself from their CSV.

This is only tested with YNAB's OFX import so it might not be 100% compliant with the actual OFX format... Feel free to help!
